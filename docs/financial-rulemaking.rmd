#Research Questions

Does variation in financial agencies' independence affect congressional success in rulemaking?

How does variation in the number of congressional coalitions affect congressional success in financial agency rulemaking?

Does either conformity or deviation from the party of the President affect congressional success?

Do members of Congress increasingly utilize partisan rhetoric over time to influence success within financial agency rulemaking?
 - Does variation in partisan rhetoric affect congressional success?


# Methods
I will gather data from 40 rules issued by financial agencies, including but not limited
to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Treasury Department, and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency. I focus on public comments issued by members of
Congress and focus on whether their demands were ultimately fulfilled in the final rule.
The research design additionally combines data from a previous study conducted by
Jennifer L. Selin, who determined an estimate of the level of structural independence for
several agencies during the Obama administration. My study will also include rules during
the subsequent Trump administration, wherein the Senate majority switched to the
Republican party. I will compare and contrast rules from both eras to determine if
influence from political parties have grown over time, including determining if there is an
increased presence of politicians commenting on policies.
I will also use textual analysis in addition to the hand coding to see if elected officials
use more partisan rhetoric over time. In this study, “partisan rhetoric” refers to an
individual making positive assertions about their own party or negative assertions about
the opposing party. I will also examine whether the demands of elected officials that are
the same party as the President are increasingly met over those of the opposing party.

# Results



### Simulated Data

To illustrate my planned analysis, I simulate data for each variable described above. 

**Dependent variable:** *Congressional success* is drawn from a discrete distribution {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. 

**Explanatory variables:** *Coalition size* (a count) is drawn from a Poisson distribution. *Business colation* is binomial. In reality, business coalitions are more common than non-business coalitions, but here I estimate a balanced sample. I set rule pages constant at 85 and draw *comment lengths* from a Poisson distribution. While in reality, less than one percent of coalitions lobbying in rulemaking opt for a mass-comment campaign, I aim to gather a balanced sample, so half of the simulated data are assumed to have no mass comment campaign (*comments* = 1, *log(comments)* = 0) and the other half have a number of *comments* drawn from a Zero-Truncated Poisson distribution, which is then transformed to a log scale. 

Table \@ref(tab:data-sim) shows ten rows of simulated data.

```{r data-sim}
library(tidyverse)
library(tibble)
library(msm)
library(kableExtra)
coalition_success <- sample(x = c(-1, -.5, 0, .5, 1), 1000, prob = c(0.1, 0.3, .1, 0.4, 0.1), replace = T)
d = tibble(rule_id = c(1:1000, rep(1001:1500, 2)),
           coalition_id = sample(1:2000),
           coalitions  = c(rep(1, 1000), rep(2, 1000)),
           coalition_unopposed = c(rep(0, 1000), rep(1, 1000)),
           coalition_success = c(coalition_success, sort(coalition_success)), 
           coalition_size = rtnorm(1000, mean = 5, sd= 10, lower = 1) %>% rep(2) %>% round(), 
           coalition_business = sample(x = c(0,1), 2000, replace = T, prob = c(0.3, .7)), 
           comment_length = round(rpois(2000, 10)/85 *100, 1), 
           comments= c(rtnorm(1000, mean = 10000, sd = 100000, lower = 100), rep(1, 1000)) %>% sample() %>% round() , 
           cong_support = c(rtnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = 5, lower = 0), rep(0, 1000)) %>% sample() %>% round() )
d %>% sample_n(10) %>% dplyr::select(rule_id, coalition_id, everything())
```

```{r hist-coalitions-sim, fig.width=2, fig.height=2,  out.width = "30%"}
ggplot(d, aes(x = coalition_success)) + geom_histogram()+ labs(x = "Coalition Success")
ggplot(d, aes(x = coalition_business)) + geom_histogram()+ labs(x = "Business Coalition")
ggplot(d, aes(x = coalition_size)) + geom_histogram()+ labs(x = "Coalition size")
```

```{r hist-comments-sim,  fig.width=3, fig.height=2, out.width = "49%"}
ggplot(d, aes( x= comment_length)) + geom_histogram()+ labs(x = "% (Comment length/proposed rule length)*100")
ggplot(d, aes( x= comments)) + geom_histogram() + labs(x = "Log(comments)")
```

### Simulated Results

Unsurprisingly this model yields no significant results (Figure \@ref(fig:model-success-plot-sim), Table \@ref(tab:mediation-sim)). With lobbying success as the dependent variable, the coefficient on the main variable of interest would be interpreted as a $\beta_{logmasscomments}$ increase in the five-point influence scale of lobbying success for each one-unit increase in the logged number of comments.

```{r model-success-sim}
m <- lm(coalition_success ~ 
          log(comments) + 
          comment_length + 
          coalition_business +  
          coalition_size + 
          coalition_unopposed, 
        data = d) 
```

```{r model-success-plot-sim,  fig.width=6, fig.height=2, out.width = "100%", fig.cap= "OLS model of coalition lobbying sucess with simulated data"}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
m %>%
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "grey") + 
  aes(x = term, 
      y = estimate, 
      ymin = conf.low, 
      ymax = conf.high) + 
  geom_pointrange( )  + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "Lobbying Success", 
       x = "") 
```

To assess the extent to which congressional support mediates the influence of public pressure campaigns on rulemaking, I estimate the average conditional marginal effect (ACME, conditional on the number of comments from Members of Congress) and average direct effect (ADE) of mass comments using mediation analysis. Model 3 in table \@ref(tab:mediation-sim) replaces the dependent varible (lobbying success) with the mediator variable (the number of supportive members of Congress). 

```{r mediation-sim}
library(mediation)
# model predicting mediator
model.m <- lm(cong_support ~  log(comments) + comment_length + coalition_business+  coalition_size + coalition_unopposed, data = d) 
# model predicting DV
model.y <- lm(coalition_success ~ log(comments) + cong_support + comment_length + coalition_business+  coalition_size + coalition_unopposed, data = d) 
med.cont <- mediate(model.m, model.y, sims=1000, treat = "log(comments)",
mediator = "cong_support")
# summary(med.cont)
library(modelsummary)
models <- list(
  "1" = m,
  "2" = model.y,
  "3"  =  model.m
)
rows <- tibble(
  term = c("Dependent Variable"),
  `1` = c("Lobbying Success"), 
  `2` =c("Lobbying Success"), 
  `3`  = c("Members of Congress in Coalition")
)

attr(rows, 'position') <- c(0)

# paper table 
modelsummary::modelsummary( models,
                            title = "Lobbying success and congressional support with simulated data",
                            stars = TRUE, 
                            #coef_omit = "president.*|agency.*|Intercept", 
                            # coef_map = cm,
                          add_rows = rows, 
                          notes = "") %>% 
  row_spec(row = 1, bold = T)
```


The average effect of the logged number of comments, conditional on letters from members of congress (the ACME) is `r round(med.cont$d.avg, 2)`, with a p value of `r round(med.cont$d0.p, 2)`.

The average direct effect (ADE) of the logged number of comments on lobbying success is `r round(med.cont$z0, 2)`, with a p value of `r round(med.cont$z0.p, 2)`

The Total Effect of a one-unit increase in the logged number of comments is `r round(med.cont$tau.coef, 2)`, with a p value of `r round(med.cont$tau.p, 2)`. `r round(med.cont$n0, 2)` of this is mediated through mobilizing congressional attention (p-value = `r round(med.cont$n0.p, 2)`).

Running a multiple regression analysis on the overall average success and independence estimates, the correlation between the level of independence of federal agencies and average success overall for combined rules, the correlation coefficient is 'r cor(federal_agencies_table$Estimate, federal_agencies_table$Avg_Success)' and the r-squared value is 0.0043, suggesting that the 0.43% of variation in success is explained by agency's level of independence.
