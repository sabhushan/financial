These revisions are in response to commenters' concerns that the language as originally proposed did not clearly state a performance standard.;Three commenters commented on the frequency of IOP submissions. One commenter requested clarification on whether a single IOP could address Start Printed Page 46494multiple EPs. Another commenter requested that BOEM consider a single IOP filed prior to an operator's first EP. The third commenter suggests the IOP be updated when an EP is updated. BOEM disagrees that an IOP will need to be updated whenever an EP is updated. An IOP is required for each exploratory drilling program planned by an operator. However, a single IOP may cover multiple EPs when sufficient geographic and operational overlap exists. The IOP serves its primary purpose before an EP is submitted, as it informs the early planning process prior to initial EP submission. Requiring the IOP to be updated after the EP's submission would not serve any practical purpose, because the EP serves as the main point of reference for both agencies and the operator after the EP is filed.",,adding a paragraph to clarify,,disagrees,,

BSEE-2017-0008,BSEE-2017-0008-0473,https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BSEE-2017-0008-0473,1,1,,,"January 25, 2018 Dear Secretary Zinke, I am writing to express strong opposition to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's (BSEE) proposed revisions to the Production Safety Systems rule. I am deeply concerned that BSEE's recent proposals will significantly weaken critical safety regulations that were adopted in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy and urge you to reject this ill-advised recommendation. I would also note that these regulations might have prevented the Deepwater Horizon spill in the first place. In 2016, BSEE finalized the Production Safety Systems rule, providing the first updates to drilling regulations since 1988. Specifically, the rule updated guidelines regulating acceptable drilling pressures at new drilling sites, in order to prevent surges and potential blowouts similar to what occurred in the Deepwater Horizon spill. The rule also imposed new requirements for emergency shutdown systems and strengthened BSEE rulemaking authority, permitting the agency to implement new industry standards into existing regulations. As you are undoubtedly aware, in 2016 BSEE adopted these regulations over the course of several years and after significant input and engagement with the public, federal policy makers, and industry stakeholders in order to enhance the safety of offshore oil and gas drilling. Now, less than two years after implementation, BSEE has suggested severely curtailing these regulations citing ""potentially unduly burdensome requirements"" on oil and gas operators. Some of the most noteworthy and egregious provisions of the proposal include: Removing the federal government's authority to regulate safe maximum or minimum drilling pressures at new drill sites. No longer requiring independent, third party auditors to certify that safety and pollution prevention equipment works under extreme conditions. Limiting BSEE's regulatory oversight by allowing oil and gas companies to adopt favorable industry standards for drilling methods. It is not only extremely premature to back off of these newly-implemented safety regulations, but it could also be catastrophic to Florida's pristine beaches and coastal economies. In fact, according to Miyoko Sakishima, director of the oceans program at the Center for Biological Diversity, BSEE's proposal ""will put our coasts and wildlife at risk of more deadly oil spills."" Sakishima went on to say that this ""isn't just deregulation, it's willful ignorance."" Furthermore, experts believe we are still years, if not decades, away from fully understanding the extent of the damage from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. This is made evident by many of the environmental impacts we are still seeing today, including the detection of Deepwater Horizon oil in migratory bird's eggs 1,000 miles away in Minnesota, increased mortality rates for bottlenose dolphins and severe physical abnormalities among bluefin and yellowfin tuna populations. Many of Florida's coastal communities are still reeling from the oil spill and additional resources are needed to help these areas fully recover. To this end, BP announced an additional $1.7 billion for clean-up costs related to the oil spill, which now totals roughly $65 billion, and the company anticipates further payments of nearly $3 billion in 2018 to aid those seeking damages. If these safeguards are so burdensome then why is the oil industry enjoying record profits? The U.S. is currently producing over 10 million barrels of oil per day - a level we have not reached since the 1970s, rivaling the world's top producer, Russia. The Gulf of Mexico accounted for nearly 21 percent of all U.S. crude oil production in 2017, and with that number expected to increase in 2018 and beyond, now is not the time to place lives and our environment at risk by lifting these important safeguards. Florida's coastal communities depend on a clean and healthy ocean and we should not jeopardize the state's economy or environment by gambling on operations that lack adequate safeguards. While the environmental impact of the spill was immense and visible for all to see, Floridians also recall the vast economic damage done to the state, which totaled around $3 billion in lost visitor spending revenue, $182.5 million in lost sales tax, and 48,000 lost jobs. That is why I am asking you to reject any proposals to roll back regulations that were specifically adopted to address safety failures that led to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. My constituents were severely impacted by the Deepwater Horizon spill, and we strongly oppose any effort to weaken these common-sense regulations that protect against another oil spill off the coast of Florida. I urge you to reject these ill-advised proposals. Don't weaken safety regulations for off-shore oil rigs. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your prompt response on this critically important matter. Sincerely, Vern Buchanan Member of Congress",,,,,Comment on BSEE-2017-0008-0001,Congressman Vern Buchanan,,2018-01-26,elected,Vern Buchanan,house-fl,1,,,center for biological diversity,Public,do not weaken regulations,,,,-2,,,,,,,,,,interesting case - constituents affected by Deepwater Horizon,

While NEPA's goal of factoring impacts to the environment into the federal decision-making process is well-intended, the statute's procedural requirements have stifled development and morphed into a vehicle for costly and time-consuming litigation. CEQ's proposed revisions to streamline the NEPA process can provide a much-needed jolt to stimulate projects across the country while maintaining the integrity of the environmental review process. I am particularly encouraged by CEQ's proposal to (1) set a two-year time limit for the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS); and (2) provide clarity regarding the requirement to consider alternatives to the proposed action. Although there are many examples to illustrate NEPA's glaring inefficiencies, one project in my Congressional District may be particularly insightful for CEQ. The proposed I-49 Inner-City Connector in Shreveport, Louisiana would unify a disjointed segment of I-49 that stretches approximately 3.8 miles. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) announced the original Notice of Intent (NOI) to unify I-49 in February 2012. The project is over eight years into the NEPA process, and there is not even a draft-EIS for agency review and Public comment. For reference, in CEQ's own ""Forty Questions"" document answering NEPA-related questions, the Council wrote ""even large complex energy projects would require only about 12 months for the completion of the entire EIS process."" A 3.8 mile stretch of highway is a far cry from some of our country's most complex energy infrastructure. The statute has clearly grown beyond its intended scope. In my view, NEPA's vague and amorphous requirement to consider alternatives to the proposed action is one of the primary reasons for delay in the I-49 project. Instead of remaining committed to the original project goal of unifying I-49 through the construction of a 3.8-mile roadway, FHWA modified the purpose of the project to allow the consideration of an alternative that is neither technically nor economically feasible. In fact, this alternative would cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than the originally-proposed 3.8-mile project, and it would require the deconstruction of an interchange with engineering characteristics found nowhere else in Louisiana. I am encouraged by CEQ's acknowledgment in the proposed rule that consideration of unreasonable alternatives can divert limited agency resources, and I respectfully urge the council to require suggested alternatives to a proposed action to be both technically and economically feasible. For decades, NEPA's seemingly innocuous requirement to incorporate environmental impacts into the federal decision-making process has resulted in significant time delays and job-killing cost overruns. Ultimately, my constituents are left with a disjointed I-49 with no resolution in sight, and there are countless other projects waiting in limbo across the country. This lack of action and certainty was not always the status quo. As President Trump explained, ""America is a nation of builders. It took four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge, five years to build the Hoover Dam, and less than one year...to build the Empire State Building."" We can get back on track in this area through common-sense NEPA reform, and we can accomplish our goals while still upholding our duties to be good stewards of the environment. It should not take more than 8 years to conduct the environmental review to construct 3.8 miles of highway. That is why I fully support CEQ's proposed regulatory changes to this burdensome statute. I look forward to seeing the implementation of this proposed rulemaking and others like it.

Though Texas state law and the city ordinances include payment limitations and effective limitations on the length of the loan, the online space in Texas includes many lenders that evade state consumer lending laws. One Texas borrower asked for help, because she was buried under a $2,500 4-year loan that included a total repayment of $13,000. When she asked for help, she had already paid $9,000 on the loan and still owed much of the principal. Under the current longterm lending proposal, this loan could meet an affordability test, unless there are further objective standards in the rule, such as a hard backend default rate that elevates regulatory scrutiny, and a front-end loan term standard to ensure that loan terms are commensurate with the size of the loan.12","Strengthen protections against loan flipping: We are concerned that the proposed rule does not go far enough to prevent the flipping of borrowers from one unaffordable loan to the next.

The outpouring of concern that the proposed regulations have generated should be interpreted as a friendly but firm reminder that the Department needs to comport with both the spirit and letter of the law's supporters.",,,,1,2,,,,"We appreciated hearing from commenters who supported the requirement to disaggregate results on each indicator, and we agree that this requirement is vitally important to ensuring equity and meeting other statutory requirements related to indicators. For too long, the performance of individual subgroups was hidden within State accountability and reporting systems, and the ESSA has maintained a focus on illuminating the performance of each subgroup by requiring in section 1111(c)(4)(B) that States measure each indicator for all students and separately for each subgroup of students. Additionally, in order to identify schools with consistently underperforming subgroups of students for targeted support and improvement, the State must consider the performance of individual subgroups based on each indicator. We understand that this requirement to disaggregate results on each indicator may limit to some degree a State's selection of indicators for its statewide accountability system, but the reasons for such disaggregation are compelling, and the ESSA requires this disaggregation. Therefore, we decline to make any changes. The only exception to this requirement, as discussed previously, is that the Progress in Achieving English Language Proficiency indicator need not be disaggregated by student subgroup because it is measured for only one subgroup: The English learner subgroup.",A number of commenters opposed the requirement and recommended the Department remove or modify this provision.,,,,,

Again, such a requirement would narrow the choices available to state and local decision-makers and lock them into a certain path, when ESSA aimed to free them from federal requirements. The Department's proposal may be a good one for some states, but it may not work for all of them. Some states may decide that a three-tier rating system may be an inappropriate way to evaluate a school's quality, and some states may decide that a single surnmative rating glosses over the varied factors that contribute to a school's success. If a state so decides, it should have the freedom to choose the method that works best for its schools.","The Department proposes specific, mandated interventions for schools that fail to test 95 percent of their students. It is certainly important to make sure that states are accounting for the performance of all of its students, but the Department's proposal too closely resembles NCLB's failed ""test and punish"" culture. Test scores are not the only indicator of a school's quality, and states should take the lead in holding their schools accountable when the 95 percent benchmark is met Additionally, the Department's proposed rule is troublingly silent on how these punitive measures would apply in instances where a state makes a good-faith effort to test all students but technological glitches outside of their control get in the way, as we have recently witnessed throughout the country.",1,1,,,,"We have revised § 200.19(d), and made conforming revisions throughout the final regulations, to allow States to: (1) Identify schools for comprehensive support and improvement no later than the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year; (2) identify schools with low-performing subgroups for targeted support and improvement that also must receive additional targeted support no later than the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year, based on data from the 2017-2018 school year, and (3) allow States to identify schools with consistently underperforming subgroups for targeted support and improvement no later than the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year. We have made also made additional clarifying edits, including renumbering and reorganizing this section, that do not change the substance of the requirements. Additionally, given revisions to the deadlines for submission of consolidated State plans, if a State chose to submit its plan in the first application window, it is possible the State may be able to begin their process for identifying schools for comprehensive and targeted support and improvement sooner than the required timeline in order to take advantage of the new multi-measure accountability systems established under the ESSA more quickly.","Some commenters also encouraged the Department to allow States, under the proposed extended implementation timelines, to maintain their lists of identified schools from the 2016-2017 school year into the 2017-2018 school year consistent with the flexibility for the 2016-2017 school year under the ESSA transition provisions.",,,,,

Although I recognize the need to reduce Federal costs associated with disaster response and recovery activities, I oppose implementing the proposed disaster deductible as it would shift costs to the States after a disaster. Instead of limiting States' access to Federal Public Assistance funds when they are in the throes of disaster response and recovery, FEMA should pursue policies that will make disasters less costly by helping States invest in hazard mitigation activities and resilience plruming before disaster strikes. ""","Revise program to ensure that costs are not shifted to states; ""Although FEMA asserts that the ""primary intent of the deductible concept is to incentivize greater State resilience to future disasters,"" 1 it appears that the primary intent ofthe deductible is to reduce Federal disaster costs by shifting the burden to States. ""","Do not place so much weight on disaster risk when creating the ratio to asses each state's disaster deductible; ""The proposed ratio to assess each State's disaster deductible places too much weight on a State's ""disaster risk,"" while failing to adequately consider a State's fiscal capacity. If a State's risk of disaster accounts for 75 percent of the disaster deductible formula, the deductible has the effect of punishing disaster-prone States by driving up disaster deductibles based on the risks of natural weather events that cannot be prevented. ""","Reduce the adiminstrative burden of the proposal; ""In addition to the fmancial hardship the disaster deductible can have on States, the proposed credit structure can also be administratively burdensome. Though States can participate in hazard mitigation and other disaster planning activities that will help to buy down deductible amounts, the administrative cost associated with keeping track of credits will add to the overall yearly cost associated with this rule.

Please see attached.,,,,,Submitted Electronically via eRulemaking Portal,Office of Alaska State Senator John Coghill,,2018-08-22,elected,John Coghill,alaska senate district b,5,,,national endangered species act reform coalition,Private,"The words “including but not limited to,” is uncertain and provides too much leeway to the Services. “Included but not limited to” should be eliminated.","The only suggestion I have is that the word “probable” be replaced with “clear and convincing.” In fact: Any time the word “probable” appears throughout section 424.11, it should be replaced with “clear and convincing.” The evidence threshold should be higher.",When a critical habitat designation limited to geographical areas occupied would: a. (1) be inadequate to ensure conservation of the species; or b. (2) result in less-efficient conversation for the species. 2. I respectfully request that the “or” be changed to “and.” In other words: Both situations need to be apparent for unoccupied areas to be considered critical habitats,,-2,,1,1,,"Comment: Several commenters stated that the phrase “including but not limited to” in the definition of physical or biological features is too vague or broad and should be removed from the definition. Response: In defining physical and biological features and including this particular phrase, we provided a non-exhaustive list of examples of types of features and conditions that we have found to be essential to certain species based on experience over many years of designating critical habitat for a wide variety of species. The determination of specific features essential to the conservation of a particular species will be based on the best scientific data available and explained in the proposal to designate critical habitat for that species, which will be available for public comment and peer review.;Some commenters stated that the word “probable” implies that the Services will rely on too low of an evidence threshold and that the word “probable” should be replaced with “clear and convincing.” Response: For maximum clarity and consistency with the statutory language, this final rule uses “likely” in place of “probable” in the relevant sentence of the provision describing the “foreseeable future.” We are making this change to avoid any unintended confusion. We further clarify that “likely,” in turn, means “more likely than not.” This interpretation is supported by case law (e.g., Alaska Oil and Gas Association v. Pritzker, 840 F.3d 671, 684 (9th Cir. 2016); Trout Unlimited v. Lohn, 645 F. Supp. 2d 929, 944 (D. Or. 2007); WWP v. FWS, 535 F.Supp.2d 1173, 1184 & n.3 (D. Idaho 2007). Our foreseeable future framework does not depart from the standards expressed in the 2009 M-Opinion that forms the basis for the framework (M-37021, January 16, 2009); rather, it is fully consistent with that opinion. Our replacement of the term “probable” with “likely” within the foreseeable future framework should also eliminate concerns that the Services are impermissibly raising the bar for listing species as threatened to something beyond a threshold of “likely” or allowing that classification determinations could be based on anything other than the “best scientific and commercial data” standard. We must rely on the “best scientific and commercial data,” available, but that data may or may not indicate whether something is likely. To determine an event is likely, we must be able to determine that it is more likely to occur than not after taking the “best scientific and commercial data” into account. We will continue to apply the best available scientific and commercial data in making our listing determinations as required under the Act.;Comment: The Services should require that both (1) occupied areas are insufficient and (2) designation of occupied areas would result in less-efficient conservation. Response: As explained above, in response to comments that the “efficient conservation” concept was vague, we have removed the provisions regarding “efficient conservation.” Thus, unoccupied areas can be considered for potential designation only if limiting the designation to occupied areas would be inadequate to ensure recovery.",several commenters,our replacement of the term,removed the provisions,,,

Zoe Lofgren,house-ca,4,,,nafsa,Public,"Implement policy; ""That is why I feel that extending STEM OPT from 17 months to 24 months and Clarifying that a student may use a prior eligible STEM degree for STEM OPT, even if the most recent degree is not in a STEM field, are smart decisions. They will benefit the United States and are fully within the legal authority of the agency. ""","Ensure flexibility in identifying STEM degrees; ""I do believe that DHS should ensure flexibility in identifying STEM degrees to allow for potential changes as fields of study evolve in the dynamic areas of science, technology and academic programs. For this reason, I am concerned by the proposed rule's reference to the 2009 Department of Education's Stats in Brief, developed by the National Center for Education Statistics, Institute of Education Services. 6 This document-now six years old-is based on undergraduate STEM degrees, which do not capture graduate level STEM fields. ""","Add accounting majors to the list of STEM majors that qualify for the STEM OPT extension; ""I ask that DHS clarify now that a degree in Accounting, or a related degree, will qualify a foreign student for STEM OPT. In the real world, an Accounting position is routinely classified as a STEM occupation, even though it may not be one that comes to mind immediately when talking about STEM. 8 """,,2,,1,-2,,,,,,,,

Ifthe statute does not support that interpretation, at aminimum the fInal regulations should eliminate extraneous reference points and duplicative buffer zones.",-1,,2,1,1,"The comments expressed that the best way to incorporate uncertainty was to express SDCs as ranges and not point estimates.Response: NMFS believes that uncertainty in SDC, OFL, and other fishing level quantities is best dealt with by fully analyzing the probability that overfishing will occur and that the stock might decline into an overfished condition, but we recognize that such a full analysis is not possible in many data-limited situations. When using a probability based approach, the distribution of probabilities includes a point estimate and it extends along a range. A probability based approach is already used in many rebuilding plans, for example, what fishing level will provide at least a 70% chance that the stock will be rebuilt in 10 years. NMFS scientists are working on a technical document that will describe some of the currently available methods to do such calculations, as well as some proxy approaches that could be used in situations where available data and methods do not allow calculation of the probability distributions.",,,,,on the side of councils,

We particularly applaud you for not exempting any payment system from the regulations, because any such exemption would invite massive evasion of the law.","However, to the extent that persons of goodwill share this concern, we think it can be addressed without incorporating a state-by-state survey of gambling laws into your final regulations (a suggestion that appears suspiciously like a stalling tactic).","As a matter of U.S. policy, gambling operations are strictly limited and regulated wherever they are not banned entirely. Therefore, we believe that a broad application of gambling enforcement laws such as UIGEA is necessary to effectuate the intent of the law. A gambling business should be required to prove it is operating legally in order to avoid the sanctions of UIGEA","We urge you to clarify that the onus of interpreting and complying with state gambling laws should rest primarily on the gambling operations that wish to do business there, not on the financial institutions or on the Treasury Department or Federal Reserve System.",2,,2,2,2,"The final rule also continues to place the responsibility for such due diligence on the participant that is establishing or maintaining the customer relationship with the commercial customer. In response to comments on the proposed rule, as discussed in more detail below, a new subsection __.6(b) of the final rule provides additional guidance on due diligence steps participants can take for commercial customers to have reasonably designed policies and procedures to prevent or prohibit restricted transactions.",,,,,,

USCIS-2006-0044,USCIS-2006-0044-2829,https://www.regulations.gov/comment/USCIS-2006-0044-2829,1,1,,,"I respectfully write regarding the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services? proposed rule to increase immigration fees (72FR USCIS 2006-0044-0001). While I understand there is a significant backlog of applications, I am concerned that the proposed fee increase will place a greater financial burden on immigrants trying to become citizens of the United States. Our country was founded by immigrants, and immigrants from around the world continue to make our nation rich with culture, heritage and tradition. The process through which they apply for citizenship should be both fair and expeditious. To achieve this goal, we must reduce the excessive backlogs and delays that immigrants continue to face. However, we should not do so in a way that makes achieving legal status simply unaffordable for many immigrant families. On average, the proposed fee increase would raise application fees by 96 percent. Rather than spreading this increase out over a period of time, it would go into effect all at once, placing a significant financial strain on applicants. The fee for naturalization applications alone would rise by 80 percent, while other application packages, such as the adjustment of status package, the petition to sponsor relatives, and the fianc? petition, would also be increased. Each of these increases could present a hardship for members of immigrant communities, which could place our already fragile immigration system under even greater strain. I am also concerned that by increasing application fees, CIS will send the wrong message to those attempting to comply with the legal process in good faith. By making compliance more difficult for struggling families to afford, we risk discouraging legal immigration while driving people to find alternative ways to come to the United States illegally. In its report, the 9/11 Commission stated that the services provided by U.S. immigration officials are a crucial element to our national security. It is vital to our homeland security efforts to keep detailed records on who is crossing our borders. Therefore, we must do everything possible to encourage adherence to our immigration laws, and to this end, the affordability of application fees must be maintained. I fully support efforts made by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services to reduce excessive backlogs application delays. In doing so, however, it is critical that the agency preserve the affordability of following proper immigration procedures. I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on this proposed rule.",,,,,Comment Submitted by James Langevin,,,2007-04-02,elected,Representative James R.

The proposed rule would guarantee overtime pay only for salaried workers earning up to $35,308 a year, and would replace a far stronger proposal put forward by President Obamas administration that would have ensured overtime pay for workers earning up to $47,0476 by 2016 phasing up to $55,068 a year. Nationally, an estimated 8.2 million workers would be left behind by the Trump administrations proposal, according to Economic Policy Institute estimates. The 8.2 million workers who would be left behind include 4.2 million women, 3.0 million people of color, 4.7 million workers without a college degree, and 2.7 million parents of children under the age of 18. Overall, U.S. workers will lose $1.2 billion dollars each and every year under this weaker proposal. In Michigan, approximately 192,000 fewer workers would be guaranteed overtime protection under the Departments weak proposal, which effectively treats workers who are paid at least $35,308 a year as highly paid executives who dont need overtime. Already, since the Trump administration abandoned President Obamas overtime proposal, Michigan workers have lost more than $56 million in overtime pay a pay cut that is hurting our states working families and our economy. The Trump administrations proposal would hurt efforts to protect Michigans middle-class workers, and to ensure that workers who must work long hours away from their families are paid fairly for their time and dedication. Even worse, the Trump administrations proposal would not be indexed to increase in future years to keep pace with rising wages and living costs, and instead would remain frozen at just $35,308. The proposed rule provides the least protection to workers in low wage industries who need the protections of the most. The current proposal does not fix the key problem with current law: the proposed salary level is still far too low given that the duties test allows workers to perform a disproportionate amount of nonexempt work while still qualifying for the overtime exemption. This combination means that the proposed rule fails to adequately protect workers who are not Executive, Administrative, or Professional (EAP) employees in any meaningful sense. For these reasons, the proposed rule departs from decades of historical precedent and undercuts the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Acts Overtime Provisions. The Department must either raise the proposed salary level significantly or strengthen the duties test in the final rule and provide a concrete rule for regularly updating the salary level in order to realize fully the promises of the FLSA. The Departments low proposed salary level is entirely insufficient to assure that employees who can pass the current duties test are truly bona fide exempt employees. Given the weak duties test in place, the proposed salary test will allow employees to be exempt even though they are performing such a disproportionate amount of nonexempt work that they are not EAP employees in any meaningful sense. For these reasons, the proposed rule does not effectively advance the purposes of the FLSAs Overtime Provisions. Raising the salary threshold to a level more comparable to the Obama administrations proposal would go a long way towards remedying this issue, as it would eliminate the need for a more stringent duties test and reduce the number of workers who are inappropriately classified as exempt and underpaid.Over time, the Departments inaction in this area has already undermined the FLSAs overarching purpose to extend pay protections broadly and exempt only a small share of the workforce from coverage. The Departments overtime proposal simply does not do enough to restore overtime pay for workers in Michigan or establish the type of strong national standard that the Departments overtime rules set in decades past. We respectfully urge the Department to reconsider its proposal and instead adopt a more adequate salary level comparable to the Obama administrations proposal, or in the alternative strengthen the duties test, and include the addition of a clear proposal for indexing.
